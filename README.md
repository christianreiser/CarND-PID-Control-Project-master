    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./


# Reflections
All of my values were chosen manually by trial and error.
## P-Value effect and tuning process
steers in proportion to the present CrossTrack Error (CTE). I choose a value 
of 0.75.
A higher value leads to a higher amplitude in the oscillations. 
If the value is lowered the car is unable to manage the curves.

## I-Value effect and tuning process
The I-value steers according to the integral of CTE over the past time. 
It is used to reduce systematic bias like a misalignment of the wheels. 
Initially, I thought I don't need it here because it is a simulators
wheels etc. are aligned perfectly. However, with I=0 the car drove too far 
on the right and finally got off the road. A small value like 0.1 helps but 
a greater value like 1 showed better results.

## D-Value effect and tuning process
The derivative value reduces overshooting (the amplitude). 
If the car has turned enough to reduce the CTE it countersteers.
I chose a value of 0.1. A smaller value leads to oscillations with a greater 
amplitude. If the value is too low, the amplitude is greater than the width 
of the road and the car falls off. A higher value slows the car down. 
After trying a lot of values, 0.1 seemed to be a good tradeoff.

## Throttle
The throttle is controlled according to the error. 
Initially, it's set to a value of 9. 
If the CTE is greater than 0.5, the throttle is reduced to 3.5.
If P_error-CTE is greater than 0.1, the throttle is reduced to 1.
If P_error-CTE is even greater than 0.2 throttle is -0.3, 
which means the car is actually breaking.
